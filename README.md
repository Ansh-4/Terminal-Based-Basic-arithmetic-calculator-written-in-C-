# Terminal-Based-Basic-arithmetic-calculator-written-in-C-


This is a simple command-line calculator written in C (`calc1.c`) that performs basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) on up to **five operands**. The calculator processes operations in the exact order entered by the user, without applying operator precedence.

## ðŸ“„ File

- `calc1.c` â€” Main C file containing the calculator logic.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `/`, and `X` (for multiplication).
- Accepts up to **five** operands in a linear calculation.
- User chooses step-by-step whether to add more operands.
- Handles invalid operator inputs.
- User-friendly prompts and instructions.

## ðŸ§® How It Works

1. User inputs the first operand.
2. User selects an operator (`+`, `-`, `/`, `X`).
3. User inputs the second operand.
4. The calculator performs the operation.
5. The user is asked if they want to enter a third operand and continues the process (up to five total operands).

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** Operators are applied **in the order entered** â€” no precedence rules like in algebra.

## ðŸ’» Compilation & Usage

### Compile

```bash
gcc calc1.c -o calc
